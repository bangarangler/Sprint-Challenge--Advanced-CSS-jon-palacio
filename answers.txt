What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

adaptive website isn't one layout that changes. but many layouts that change
with breakpoints set at different screen sizes.
responsive is one layout that "responds" to the screen size.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

mobile first would use min-width media queries and would be designed for
"mobile first" so much content is consumed on phones now that it makes since
but can make designing more difficult as you have to be much more selective
with your content.  desktop first is with max-width in mind and you simply
make it responsive from big to small. it's typically easier to design as
no limits to creativity really but you may lose some of the elements when you
start to scale down for smaller screens.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

it gives us the ability to use rem by having it make 1rem = 10px. easier to
think about, easier to work with.

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

its a way to write css that gives you lots of added perks for a very small
learning curve. it will save you time in your css files and arguably is much
easier to read if you abide by some basic rules and don't let your nesting get
out of hand.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

favorite concept is well honestly kind of like all of it. very helpful tool.
most trouble. probably just changing mind set from normal css to a
preprocessor. once you know it it's really hard to want to go back to the old
way.
